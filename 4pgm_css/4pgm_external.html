<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered
coronavirus.
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory
illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying
medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer
are more likely to develop serious illness.</p>
<p style="color:Black">The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or
discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you
also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</p>
